# DjangoTutorial

This is my code from completing the intro to Django tutorial (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro/).

The tutorial was a detailed, step-by-step walk-through on creating a basic poll application. The poll application consists of the user-facing site (users can participate in polls), the admin site (admins can edit polls), and basic automated testing.
